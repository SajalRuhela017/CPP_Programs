//In a perticular field, there are trees in a single row from left to right. Each tree has a value V. You cut trees from left to right and for each tree of value V that you cut, you plant (V+1)%M trees on the right most end with values ranging from 0 to ((V+1)%M)-1.
//Initially there was only one tree with value 2. Find total number of trees present after cutting K trees.

//INPUT FORMAT
//k, dnenoting number of trees to cut
//m, denoting the modulus value

//OUTPUT FORMAT
//total number of trees present after cutting K trees

//Example 1
//INPUT: k = 1, m = 5
//OUTPUT: 3

//Example 2
//INPUT: k = 1, m = 2
//OUTPUT: 1
